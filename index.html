            <h3>하는 일?</h3>
            <p>
              Boxen can clone your projects, install your toolchains, apply security policies, configure your favorite music player, set your screensaver, clone your dotfiles, and scream for help when things go haywire. The example repository at <a href="http://github.com/boxen/our-boxen">boxen/our-boxen</a> shows how to require Full Disk Encryption, install packages from Homebrew, ensure the presence of some default Ruby and node.js versions, run nginx, and resolve custom requests to a local <code>.dev</code> domain.
            </p>

            <p>We've written <a href="https://github.com/boxen">roughly a bajillion libraries</a> for Boxen, covering everything from configuring elasticsearch to disabling &ldquo;natural&rdquo; scrolling to installing Minecraft. If we don't have what you need, you can <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-template">write your own</a>. You can customize and extend your team's Boxen environment as well: If you have to install something manually, it's a bug.</p>
